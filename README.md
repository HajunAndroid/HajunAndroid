### Who i am ðŸ‘‹
##### Hello, My name is Hajun. I am a student majoring in software engineering. I was a student with no confidence in development. But recently, I have a dream of becoming an Android developer, so I have been studying development with passion and fun. I found interest in development a little late, but please look forward to it!
##### My current interests are Android and Computer vision.
