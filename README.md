### Who i am ðŸ‘‹
##### Hello, My name is Hajun. I'm studying Android Programming. I was a student with no confidence in development. But recently, I have a dream of becoming an Android developer, so I have been studying development with passion. I found interest in development a little late, but please look forward to it!
##### >My current interests are Android and Computer Vision.
##### >I completed 'Computer Vision and Deep Learning using OpenCV'at Fast Campus (2021.01 ~ 2021.04). Also, I acquired TOPCIT Level 2 (2021.05).
